## About Me

Hello! I'm **Zheng Wang (王铮)**, a third-year undergraduate student pursuing a B.Eng. in **Artificial Intelligence: System and Technology** at **The Chinese University of Hong Kong**.

My research focuses on understanding and improving **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, particularly in the areas of **reasoning capabilities**, **trustworthy AI**, and **large-scale evaluation methodologies**. I'm passionate about bridging the gap between cutting-edge AI research and real-world applications, especially in domains that can benefit society such as healthcare and mental health support.

I have been fortunate to contribute to research published at **ACL 2025 Findings** and am currently leading a benchmark project under review at ARR. Through my undergraduate research journey, I've gained hands-on experience in multi-agent systems, LLM evaluation frameworks, and semantic diversity metrics.
