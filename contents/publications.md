## Publications

**A survey of LLM-based agents in medicine: How far are we from Baymax?**  
*ACL 2025 Findings* | Co-second Author  
Spearheaded the design of the paper's primary classification system (Taxonomy), categorizing medical agents by architectural complexity and clinical application. Screened and analyzed over 100 recent papers to identify core bottlenecks in clinical reasoning and multi-agent collaboration.

**AgeMindBench: Benchmarking LLMs for Age-Diverse Mental Health Support**  
*Under Review (ARR 2026)* | Co-second Author | Collaboration with Renmin University AIM3 Lab  
Led the research team in developing a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs across age-diverse mental health scenarios. Developed a manual evaluation platform with TypeScript and designed a multi-agent system with LangChain to automate interaction simulation. Curated 1,249 seeker profiles across five life stages grounded in developmental psychology.

## Research Experience

**Diversity Evaluation of LLMs via Schur Complement Entropy**  
*CUHK Undergraduate Summer Research Internship* | June — Aug 2025  
Adapted Schur Complement Entropy (SCE) as a novel metric for semantic diversity in LLM outputs, providing a more robust measure than traditional metrics for high-dimensional text generation. Conducted evaluations on open-source LLMs, proving SCE's effectiveness in capturing "mode collapse". Developed an evaluation toolkit in Python, optimizing kernel-based entropy calculations for long-text generation.
