## Research Experience

### Diversity Evaluation of LLMs via Schur Complement Entropy
**CUHK Undergraduate Summer Research Internship** | June — Aug 2025

- Proposed **Schur Complement Entropy (SCE)** as a novel metric for measuring semantic diversity in LLM-generated text
- Demonstrated SCE's superiority over traditional metrics in capturing **mode collapse** in high-dimensional outputs
- Developed an open-source **evaluation toolkit** in Python with optimized kernel-based entropy calculations
- Conducted comprehensive evaluations on multiple open-source LLMs
